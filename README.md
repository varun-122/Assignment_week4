# Disney+ EDA Project

This project contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Disney+ content data. The goal is to uncover key insights about the type, genre, release year, duration, and ratings of content available on Disney+, helping stakeholders understand trends and patterns in the platform's offerings.

## Project Overview

The dataset used includes various features such as title, type (Movie/TV Show), genre, release year, and other metadata. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, we performed data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to explore:

- Content distribution by type and genre  
- Trends in content production over the years  
- Duration analysis for movies and TV shows  
- Correlation between content rating and type  
- Missing value handling and data preprocessing

This project showcases data storytelling, visualization, and Python skills aimed at providing actionable insights from streaming service data.
